# Ghost_Events_Gaming

## Description

Storefront for Ghost Gaming. This will have a landing page showcasing the different products available for the customer. Once you log in, you will have access to your own inventory of cards pulled from the larger inventory stock.

When you choose a Product you will be able to see all of the items related to the franchise and then go into the sets in each franchise and further going down to the cards in each of those sets.

The landing page should be dynamic, allowing the view to only include the products you chose.

## Installation

- You will be able to clone this repo from https://github.com/MLazalde/Ghost_Events_Gaming.git. The needed dependencies will be included in the Package json but will still require you to run npm i and for you to create a .env file following the template as follows:

> `DB_NAME= ghost_gaming`

> `DB_USER= ""`

> `DB_PASSWORD= ""`

(make sure to replace the double quotation marks with your postgres credentials.)

## Usage

- Once you have cloned the repo and installed all of the dependencies, you will need to connect to postgres and run the schema.sql file from the db/ folder. This will create the database for us to work from. You can exit out of pg for the time being. Next, to seed this database, you will run "npm run seed".

- The site should have all the data necessary to be able to use the functionality of this repo. Start collecting your cards!
